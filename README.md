A class project of an implementation of a data visualisation idea. My idea is to compare 2 datasets(Air Popullation data and Life Expectancy data).
I will be using a Scatter Plot Chart, where each dot will represent a new country.


X-axis: Air Quality Index
Y-axis: Life expectancy in years
Population is determined by the colour of the dot.

I will use JavaScript and D3.js
